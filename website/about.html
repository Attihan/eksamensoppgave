                    <h2>Climbing a Wall!</h2>
                    <p>The OTS Klatregruppa (Climbing Group) at P35, OsloMet University, offers a low-threshold 
                    climbing experience tailored to students. Specifically, on Tuesdays, they host climbing sessions 
                    that are open to students with climbing certifications (brattkort/ledkort) and those who are either 
                    looking for climbing partners or simply wish to share the climbing experience with fellow enthusiasts.
                    This inclusive setup ensures that the climbing wall is accessible to all OsloMet students.</p>
                        
                    <p>
                        The Climbing Group provides essential equipment such as shoes, harnesses, ropes, belay devices,
                        rappel devices, chalk bags, crash pads, and quickdraws that can be borrowed. This makes it
                        hassle-free for students to get involved and embrace the excitement of climbing, regardless 
                        of their prior experience or equipment. It's an opportunity for students to not only explore 
                        the thrill of climbing but also to build a sense of community among fellow climbers, making 
                        it a well-rounded and accessible experience for all.
