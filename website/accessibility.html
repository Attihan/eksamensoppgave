                    <h1> Accessibility log </h1>
                    <h2> First edition </h2>

                    <p> In this page, we will talk about accessibility and how we can utilize tools like lighthouse and WAVE to make
                        our page better.
                        Our process consists of making a page. Afterwards, test the page with WAVE and lighthouse tool. We document
                        and log the feedback results which we get from the lighthouse and the WAVE tool.
                        Then we improve our pages on the website by learning and documenting from using the lighthouse tool.
                        Hence why we use the title "Accessibility log". 
                    </p>

                    <p>In the first edition, we have established a design for each page. We also have made content for every
                        page.
                        Below is the first version of the "about" page, this is one of our pages we tested:
                     </p>
                        <hr>
                        <img src="img/accessibilityscore_ver1.jpg" alt="Score of accessibility test">
                        <img class="lighthouseversion1" src="img/accessibility_ver1.jpg" alt="Accessibility test taken with lighthouse">
                        <hr>    
                    <p> By analyzing the results, we concluded that there were some things that we had to change. The
                        design itself did not have sufficient color contrast, therefore we changed this.
                        When removing the background color on the side of the page, it resulted in better scores on
                        lighthouse.
                        We also seem to get feedback about meta not being included in the page. This is important to
                        include because this allows us to fit the content according to the user's device.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> There were also feedback revolving around image size and properly sized images. The file size of the pictures were 
                        too big for the website itself, therefore it took too long to load in the pages. By changing pictures from PNG formats
                        to JPEG it will make the image file size smaller. In addition, we also changed the resolution on some images. 
                        Some of the images were very big as the original size, we had to downsize them by making the resolution smaller.
                        This resulted in faster loading times.  
                    </p>
                        
                    <p> Alternate text on images was something that were missed at the start. By doing a WAVE test, we could pinpoint which image
                        that did not have an alternate text. 
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Final version</h2>
                    <p>When testing the final version with lighthouse, we could say that we are content with our websites. 
                        The results came in, and we got 100 score troughout the test. This shows us that our website is 
                        well functioned. By improving with lighthouse feedback, we can be even more sure that our website has high quality 
                        when it comes to performance, accessibility and best practice. It is also important to note that by making the website
                        have faster loading times, we contribute to less data being uploaded, therefore more cost-efficientl and requires 
                        less upload/download speed.
                    </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>By analyzing the picture above, we can safely say that most issues have been resolved. However, there are two 
                        issues still maintaining. These issues were something we tried to fix, but the issues still did not get removed.
                        We deemed theese issues as something that cannot be resolved, a bug.</p>
