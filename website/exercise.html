                                the practical part of the midwifery education. She also shaped the midwife’s central
                                role in a modern maternity ward. Johnsen took education in Oslo, Bergen, and London.
                                During the Balkan wars, she worked as a nurse. From 1914 she was chief midwife at
                                Rikshospitalet. </div>

                                radioactivity and radiochemistry. She discovered a more accurate determination of the
                                half-life of radium. This had significant importance for international science. She
                                studied in Copenhagen and was a research assistant for Marie Curie. Gleditsch was a
                                prominent advocate for women's rights and Norway's second female professor."</div>

                                for her advocacy for contraception, sexual education, and children's rights. According
                                to her perspective, public responsibility and just laws were crucial to ensure the
                                rights of both children and mothers. Møller was an active proponent of the Castberg
                                child laws, which protected children born out of wedlock. In 1924, she founded the
                                Mother Hygiene Office in collaboration with women in the labor movement.</div>
