                    <h2>Discounted membership at SIO Athletica</h2>
                    <p>The current price for membership at SIO Athletica is 240 NOK per month when you are a student at OsloMET. Athletica has 6 centers in Oslo, which you can view <a href="https://sio.no/trening/vare-sentre" target="_blank">on this link</a>.

Beyond OSI, there are many other organizations not affiliated with OSI that you can participate in. Most organizations are beginner-friendly or have suitable level divisions. An overview of all sports organizations can be found on the <a href="https://www.sio.no/associations/find-your-association?type=6" target="_blank">SIO website</a>.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, you don't necessarily need to be a member of a student organization to find a group to train with. Athletica offers various types of group classes, from different types of dance to various types of yoga. Additionally, there are various cardio and strength training classes offered. Moreover, Athletica also offers classes in muay thai, jiu-jitsu, and boxing for those interested in martial arts.

You can also check if the classes are full; it's often advisable to try to book 5-7 days in advance, as some classes are popular.</p>
